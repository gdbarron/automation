title: Cybersecurity: a cryptographic hash solution for your PowerShell module
---

## Background

With all the cybersecurity hacks happening lately and the [nation's initiative to secure software](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/), and specifically open source, I wanted to contribute.  My VenafiPS module works with the products from Venafi, specifically Trust Protection Platform and Venafi as a Service.  The module makes it easy to automate against these machine identity management products, but with all automation solutions, it could be used to someone else's advantage in quick order as well.  To help combat any manipulation of the module code, I have built file hash validation into the release process and module itself.  This post will describe how I implemented it.

## Approach

The release process for VenafiPS automatically determines and updates the version in the metadata .psd1 file.  Since we want to determine the file hash for all files in the module, it seemed the right time to do it was right after all these updates were done.  We calculate the file hash, in this case using SHA256, and store them all in a file in a GitHub release which allows us to easily gain access to it later.  In the module, a function is created to pull down this file, and compare the hashes against the currently executing module.

## Release pipline

In the release pipeline, we not only need to update the psd1 version, but we've [added a version to the psm1](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiPS/blob/c6b80c451e9e9182f7b12c5f98089b69cb9dac49/VenafiPS/VenafiPS.psm1#L28) as well which will be used in the `Test-ModuleHash` function.  Since we want to calculate the hash at this point, I threw together a powershell script to take care of it.

``` powershell
$path = '.'
$fullPath = Resolve-Path $path | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path
Get-ChildItem -Path $path -Recurse | Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 | Select-Object Hash, 
@{
    'n' = 'File'
    'e' = {
        $_.Path.Replace("$fullPath\", '')
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File -FilePath ../hash.json
```
This will create a .json file with a list of file paths and hashes.

The next step is to create a GitHub release in your pipeline.  I'm using Azure DevOps and there is already an available [task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/github-release?view=azure-devops) for this.  The key is to add hash.json to your list of assets and ensure you tag it with the appropriate version.
